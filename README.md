# PlateSight - Malaysian Food Recognition System

An intelligent web application that leverages computer vision and deep learning to automatically identify Malaysian cuisine. Built with modern web technologies for scalable deployment and cross-platform accessibility.

## üéØ Overview

PlateSight is a production-ready food recognition system that accurately identifies 17 traditional Malaysian dishes using state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. The application provides real-time analysis through an intuitive web interface.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-modal input support (images, videos, live camera)
- Real-time object detection with confidence scoring
- Responsive web interface built with Streamlit
- Multiple pre-trained models for optimal performance
- Scalable architecture suitable for production deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **ML Models**: YOLO v11/v12, Custom Roboflow model
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Ultralytics
- **Backend**: PyTorch, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready, cloud-compatible

## üöÄ Quick Start
